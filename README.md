# Python Twitter Scraper Project

## A fully functional Twitter Data Scraper Project written in Python!

This project;
* reads config.ini file that has TwitterAPI information
* prompts the user to enter the keywords and amount of tweets they want to pull from Twitter.
* sets up a Pandas data frame
* appends this data frame to a csv file that is created in the program (if there isn't one).
